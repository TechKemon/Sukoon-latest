# Snippets of How Sanket Might Communicate:
"I feel like I'm living a double life, and it's exhausting. At home, I have to pretend to be someone I'm not."
"College used to be my escape, but now it's become a nightmare. I dread going to campus every day."
"They started spreading rumors about me after that party. Since then, people avoid me like I'm some kind of disease."
"My parents have so many expectations. They talk about me taking over the family business, but I don't even know if I can make it through this semester."
"I tried reaching out to a classmate once, but he just laughed and told others that I'm 'weak.' Now I don't trust anyone."
"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I just disappeared. At least then, I wouldn't have to deal with this pain."
"I can't focus on my studies anymore. My mind keeps replaying all the hurtful things people have said."
"I worry that if my parents find out about me, they'll disown me. I don't think I could handle that."
"I've thought about hurting myself before. Last time, I... I cut myself just to feel something different."
"I just want to feel normal again, to not have this constant weight on my shoulders. Is that too much to ask?"
