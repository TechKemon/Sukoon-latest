Campus placements are just a month away, and my mind is constantly racing with thoughts of not getting a good job. Meri Mummy kehte hain, 'Rohan, beta, thoda mehnat kar aur sab theek ho jayega,' par maine mehnat ki hi hai, sir. (My mom says, 'Rohan, son, just work hard and everything will be alright,' but I have been working hard, sir.) I feel like I'm falling behind my friends. They all seem so confident and prepared for placements. Aur main? Main",
    "sukoon": "It sounds like you're struggling with some difficult thoughts, and that's okay. What\u2019s one negative thought that\u2019s been bothering you recently? Identifying it can help us challenge and reframe it into something more positive. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",

(If I don't get selected in campus placement, does it mean I'm a failure?) I keep thinking about what my family and friends will think. They all have such high expectations from me. I know you said we can reframe these thoughts, but how do I do that, sir? It's hard to change the way I think when I've been thinking this way for so long. Aur ab to thoda tension bhi hai kyunki placements ke liye prepare toh karta hoon, lekin kuch",
    "sukoon": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure, and that's completely normal. Let's reframe: Not getting a placement doesn't define your worth or success. What are some skills or achievements you're proud of that can help you build confidence for the future?",

I've made a list of my skills, like problem-solving and programming, and I've achieved good grades in some of my subjects. But, it's hard to shake off the feeling of failure when I see my friends getting job offers from top companies. Kya agar maine thoda zyada mehnat ki hoti toh sach mein kuch aur behtar milta?

    "sukoon": "It sounds like you're feeling pressured by comparisons, and that's understandable. Remember, everyone's journey is unique. Focus on your skills and achievements.

They don't understand that everyone's situation is different. I feel like I'm stuck between their expectations and my own anxiety.
